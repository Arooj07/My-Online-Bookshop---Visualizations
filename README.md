# My-Online-Bookshop---Visualizations
In this project using the .NET Framework, I designed "my online book shop" site in which I used structures and classes for defining (entering) information for each book. And users just have to visit my site and by seeing ratings and information of each book he can place an order also. This all has also been done using visualizations.
